# Ingreedy 🍳
Turn the ingredients you have into meals you’ll love with a little help from AI.

Ingreedy is an iOS app that helps home cooks quickly figure out what to cook, discover new recipes, and share favorites with friends. It combines a delightful SwiftUI experience with an AI assistant (Gemini) that understands your pantry, preferences, and constraints.

## What Ingreedy Does 

- **Transforms your ingredients into ideas**: Tell Ingreedy what you have, and it suggests recipes or simple dishes you can make right now.
- **Suggests smart substitutions**: Missing an ingredient? Ingreedy recommends realistic swaps and alternatives.
- **Personalizes to your taste**: It learns your dietary preferences, disliked ingredients, and cooking style.
- **Helps you discover recipes**: Browse featured and popular recipes tailored to your context.
- **Makes cooking social**: Share recipes with friends, see what they’re cooking, and swap inspiration.

## Who It’s For

- **Busy people** who don’t want to think too hard about dinner.
- **Beginner cooks** who need guidance and substitutions.
- **Food lovers** who enjoy finding and sharing great recipes.
- **Health-conscious users** managing diets and ingredients.

## How It Works

1. **Start with what you have**  
   Enter your ingredients or pick from suggestions. The AI understands the context (e.g., “eggs, spinach, feta”).

2. **Get instant meal ideas**  
   Ingreedy suggests recipes or quick meals, with options to filter by difficulty, time, or dietary needs.

3. **Adapt with substitutions**  
   Missing an item? Ask for realistic swaps that won’t ruin the dish.

4. **Cook with confidence**  
   View clear steps, tips, and optional AI guidance while cooking.

5. **Share and get inspired**  
   Send recipes to friends and receive theirs in a clean, chat-like inbox.
